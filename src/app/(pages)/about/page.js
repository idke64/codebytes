            Welcome to CodeBytes, a regional competition founded by the 2023 -
            2024 computing clubs of Neuqua Valley High School and Naperville
            Central High School.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Made with the vision of creating an intuitive experience that
            incorporates the many flavors of computing, CodeBytes prides itself
            in its unique event structure and variability. We include the
            traditional competitive problems that national tournaments focus
            upon, as well as numerous subjects that reference the vast field of
            computer science (such as data science, web development, botting).
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            The story of CodeBytes returns to the summer of 2023, where the
            upcoming NVHS Computing Team Captains sought a way to enhance the
            competitive programming experience. Based in a region where
            little-to-no communication between adjacent schools&apos; teams
            existed, the norm in competitions was simply online, independent,
            national competitions that did not offer much at face value. Thus,
            the idea of a local recurring competition was born in the hearts of
            these founders.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            One day, a meeting was called between NVHS and NCHS to discuss
            possible relations and to pitch the ideaâ€”only to discover that the
            NCHS Captains had also been in the works of forming their Computer
            Science League. Struck with the knowledge, the two teams came
            together to form CodeBytes over the span of several months.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Now, we are expanding, all in the hopes of achieving our goal of
            keeping competitive programming both engaging and relevant.
