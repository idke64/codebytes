# Events

#### Competitive Programming Problems (700 Points)

##### General Details

- Teams will work to solve as much Competitive Programming problems as possible.
- The time and memory constraints on each problem may vary.
- I/O should use standard input and output.
- Files will be saved as `Main.extension` when run on our servers.
- Teams are free to use the internet when solving problems, but are not allowed to use any form of AI.

##### Scoring

- Each problem contains 10 test cases, with each test case being worth 10 points for a total of 100 possible points per problem.
- The submission that earns the most points is the only one that contributes to the team's total score.
- There is no penalty for incorrect submissions.

##### Testcase Codes

- NA - not attempted
- AC - accepted
- WA - wrong answer
- TLE - time limit exceeded
- RE - runtime error
- CE - compilation error
- LD - loading
- ER - general error

##### Troubleshooting

Some common problems you might encounter:

- Make sure nothing else is outputted besides the expected output.
- Don't ask the user for input.

#### Front-End Event (300 Points)

##### General Details

- Teams will work to create a frontend application related to a prompt or theme.
- Teams are free to use any frameworks, libraries, or tools available to them.
- It is recommended to use [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com) to submit your source code but other methods are accepted ([Replit](https://replit.com), [CodePen](https://codepen.io), [GitHub](https://github.com))
- You may optionally create a video to showcase specific aspects of your application.

##### Scoring

- Submissions will be judged based on a set criteria: Complexity, Functionality, Aesthetics, and Responsiveness.
- Each criteria is scored from 0-10
- Your total score will be your criteria score SCORE / 40 \* TOTAL_POINT_VALUE.
- Multiple judges will review each submission to ensure fairness.
- Resubmissions are allowed, and only the highest score will be counted.

- The quiz is split into 3 sections: Bit Trivia, Brute Force, and Problem Statement
- Bit Trivia is worth 100 points. This category dives into the history, complexities, and trivial matters of computing.
- Brute Force is worth 200 points. This category is made up of a variety of multiple choice questions.
- Problem Statement is worth 400 points. This category is made up of free response questions related to computational mathematics and theory.
- Calculators are allowed, but external calculator programs are not.
- Quizzes will be done on paper.
- Teams cannot use the internet or any outside sources.

##### General Details

- Teams will work to write code that best attempts to solve a coding problem without an optimal solution.
- Problems do not have a "best" solution that works for the provided time constraints.

##### Scoring

- Each problem is worth 200 points with the point values being distributed based on the accuracy of the final answer.
- Solutions will be graded based on the criteria specified in the problem statement.

##### Submissions

- Submissions will be done through [Google Forms](https://forms.gle/wfSJGZW2mC1ZZkcS9) for this competition.
