#### General

Welcome to CodeBytes, a regional coding competition founded by the 2023 - 2024 computing teams of Neuqua Valley High School and Naperville Central High School.

Made with the vision of creating an intuitive experience that incorporates the many flavors of computing, CodeBytes prides itself in its unique event structure and variability. We include the traditional competitive problems that national tournaments focus upon, as well as numerous subjects that reference the vast field of computer science (such as data science, web development, botting, etc.).

We are a predominantly Illinois-based competition, but all are welcome to participate in the contests. Only highschool-or-equivalent students are eligible to earn prizes. All events are in-person and will have snacks and accomodations included.

#### Permitted Languages

#### Contest Format

Each competition will be different from the last in terms of the amount and types of events, ensuring that each experience is fresh and exciting for the participants.

Information on individual events and additional content may be found on each competition's packet.

#### Academic Integrity

All students that participate in CodeBytes are expected to uphold a policy of academic integrity. Since this competition is a school-representative tournament, there are regulations that must be followed to ensure fairness. A list of rules may be found after this section.

By registering for CodeBytes, it is understood that each student has read and abides by the guidelines set in place. Any violations will be enforced under a "zero tolerance" policy and may result in disqualification. Punishments may range from individual event locks, student disqualification, team disintegration, and school disqualification.

#### Code of Conduct

As mentioned above, this section will discuss the rules that every participant is expected to follow. All rules are final and may be flexible depending on the circumstances. Attempts to circumvent these rules may qualify for disqualification.

1. Teams may only have a maximum of four members.

   - Only the top three teams per school will be considered in the final score count for the school leaderboard.
   - Teams are only eligible for leaderboard positions if they are made up of members from one single school. Mismatching students may participate and receive prizes, but will not be considered in the final leaderboard scores.
   - Dividing and conquering is allowed and encouraged.

2. Cross - Cross-team Communication is forbidden and will be considered a form of cheating.

   - This includes communication between one school's teams, or between two different schools' teams.
   - Casual conversation is permitted. Discussions on answers are not.
   - Suspicion of communication may result in time or point deductions or disqualification.

3. The usage of AI or any equivalents is strictly prohibited for all events and purposes. Any evidence of this rule being violated will disqualify the entire team.

   - This may extend to a complete ban from CodeBytes. All work must be yours and yoursÂ **only**.

4. Internet access varies from event to event. Review each event's rules to understand if your team may use the internet's tools to help you succeed.

5. Horseplay, sabotage, or internal misdirection will not be tolerated.

6. Submission of any code that behaves in a malicious manner will result in a permanent ban from future competitions and will be forwarded to authorities.

   - Offenses include tampering with the grading system, slowing the servers, creating network vulnerabilities, script injection, etc.
   - All code submissions will be done only by our website and any alternative methods or automated processes are not permitted.

7. Unfair attempts to inflate a score or tamper with grading processes will result in a removal from the tournament.

8. Should a tie arise, discussions across all school representatives will undergo to determine if the schools both will compete in a tie-breaker, or if both schools will take home victory.

9. Rules may differ depending on the event, and may be updated over time. It is expected that all participants review the rules before the competition begins.

If you find a problem with any of the events, rules, or data, contact an organizer immediately.
