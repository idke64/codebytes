#### Foreword

This page is meant to be a more user-friendly guidebook to understanding the competitions.

The information listed here is not meant to be viewed as a replacement for the original rules put in place, unless otherwise specified.

#### Team Guidelines

This section is intended to remind and clarify information upon teams.

- Teams can only have up to 4 members. However, participants are free to work individually if they'd like.
  - That is, teams can be less than 4 members, and can allow for the members to jump between **Simultaneous Events**.
    - **Simultaneous Events** are when there is more than one event ongoing at the same time. It is generally permitted for participants to jump between these events while that block is ongoing.
  - No compensatory points will be given to teams that have less than four members. However, individuals may be given bragging rights if they happen to be the best-scoring out of all participants.
- Only the points of the top 3 teams from a school will count towards their school's total points.
  - This is to combat school size from dominating the leaderboards. If a school has less than two teams participating, a third "placeholder" team based on some criterion decided during the event will be incorporated into their scoring.
    - This criterion may involve the median, mean, or mode scores of all schools. This will be determined by the committee during the event.
  - For a team's points to be considered toward a school's score, the team must be made up of only students from that school.
    - Teams made up of students from different schools may still be eligible for prizes, but their points will not be counted for any school in particular, and are not placed on the leaderboard.
- A team's total points includes the sum of all the points earned from the events they participated in.
  - Once a block is over, all points are finalized for that block. Late submissions for each event will not be accepted, unless the committee deems it necessary.
  - Some events may have special requirements regarding their points. Be sure to review their information before the competition.
- Teams must have an account to participate in the contest.
  - Submissions may be permitted without an account (for the sake of practice and testing), but points and leaderboard placements cannot be given without registration.
- Cross - Team Communication whether it is to their own or some other school is forbidden during the events.
  - This only applies to the event matter at hand. Conversation is permitted, but discussion of algorithms or answers are not.
- In the event of a team dissolving in the middle of a competition, all prior points will be ignored.
  - That is, any points earned by the team will not be "split" into new forming teams. Ongoing team-creation must be done during a break, and with permission from the committee.

#### Event Guidelines

This section is intended to remind and clarify information upon events.

- Events are judged according to their own set of criteria by competition organizers.
  - Judges will be from multiple schools, and maintain a no-bias policy to keep the tournament fair.
- Events will vary in total points offered, and will be specified before the competition begins.
  - More information will be provided in the event descriptions and the contest's page. Be sure to check in frequently.
- Depending on the event, resubmissions may or may not be allowed.
  - It is a general policy that in the default Competitive Programming Problems event, resubmissions are allowed and even encouraged.
  - If an error has been found to be made, a resubmission may be permitted.
- Events follow a "simultaneous blocking" pattern, in which the entire competition will be composed of blocks that have multiple events ongoing.
  - For example, the tournament may consist of two "blocks", that happen one after the other, while inside those blocks are "simultaneous" events that are ongoing at the same time. Block A contains events 1 and 2 together, while Block B happens after A, containing events 3 and 4 together.
- The Competitive Programming Problems event is guaranteed for all iterations of CodeBytes. Other events may sprout and decay in different seasons and schedules. These events will be announced a month beforehand.
  - It is important to keep track of our announcements page, as certain events may be more obscure than others. If practice is on your mind, this is the way.
- Information and Guidelines relating to each event will be updated and added to this page as an addendum.

#### Competitive Programming Problems Event

This section details the universal "Competitive Programming Problems" event, which will be present in every contest.

- Submitted code has to use standard input and standard output.
  - That is, it cannot have a buffer or read from a file, etc.
  - It must also remain under the same class. Multiple separated classes are not accepted.
- Test Case Status:
  - AC - Accepted.
  - WA - Wrong Answer.
  - CE - Compilation Error.
  - RE - Runtime Error.
  - TLE - Time Limit Exceeded.
  - LD - Loading.
  - ER - Error.
- The number of problems will vary depending on the competition and complexity. The default remains 10 problems for a total of 1000 points.
  - This will only change in special events. These will be clarified beforehand.
  - Each problem contains 10 test cases, with each test case being worth 10 points for a total of 100 possible points per problem.
- The submission that earns the most points is the only one counted.
  - There is no limit or penalty for incorrect submissions.
  - Submissions that are inefficient will not be docked points.
- Teams are free to use the internet when solving problems, but are not allowed to use any form of AI.
  - This is a disqualifying offense. No amount of AI is permitted.
- Submissions may be reviewed if cheating or other issues are suspected. As a result, be wary of the information you submit.

#### Front-End Event

This section details the "Front End" event, which may or may not be present in a competition.

- Also known as the "web-design" competition, the part of the competition where you have to improvise from scratch.
  - And we mean, *improvise.*
- Each event, a prompt/theme will be given. It is your responsibility to interpret and expand upon that theme.
  - For all intents and purposes, your website should be safe for work. Please do not submit vulgar websites, as we will pass the information along to your school.
- Judged based on set criteria that will be made clear as part of the competition.
  - Complexity is the first test, ranging from `0 - 10`.
  - Functionality is the second test, ranging from `0 - 10`.
  - Aesthetics is probably the most important, the third test, ranging from `0 - 10`.
  - Responsiveness, or speed, is the final test, ranging from `0 - 10`.
- StackBlitz will be how we handle submissions for website development. Be ready to create an account if needed!
- Summed to a final score of 800 points, gained from the sum of all your points multiplied by 20.
- As this portion is technically subjective, we have multiple judges reviewing the websites to ensure fairness.

#### Theoretical Assessment Event

This section details the "Theoretical Assessment" event, which may or may not be present in a competition.

- Better known as the "Quiz Event", ranking one of the lowest in scores, but a quick category to achieve.
  - Notoriously known as the "be-all end-all”, as once an assessment is submitted, it can never be returned to. The final standing between two teams may very well be differentiated through this event.
- Composed of categories that discuss different topics, all available at once for a combined total of 800 points.
  - "Bit Trivia" is worth a total of 100 points. This category dives into the history, complexities, and trivial matters of computing. The number of problems is always set to 10 every competition.
    - All forms of trivia are fair game here. How well can you do?
  - "Brute Force" is worth a total of 200 points. This category is considered the non-trivia multiple choice section, made up of a variety of topics. May or may not be timed, depending on the event description. The number of problems may differ.
  - "Problem Statement" is worth a total of 400 points. This category is considered the free response section, mostly consistent with computational mathematics and theory. The number of problems may differ.
- Some problems may be worth more than others and will be labeled accordingly as "Fast Fate".
  - Falls under an "all-or-nothing" basis. The problem and accompanying problems must be completely correct to qualify as fast-fate.
- No partial credit will be given on MCQ-type assessments unless otherwise stated or handled.
- All quizzes will be done on paper and will occur in a separate room from the designated computer labs.
  - This means that team-communication will be limited. Plan accordingly.
- Any usage of the internet or outside sources will result in complete disqualification of your team.
- Calculators are allowed, but external calculator programs are not.
  - External calculator programs are programs that do not remain in the calculator when the memory is completely erased.
- All quizzes must be submitted five minutes prior to the event completion for the submissions to be counted for points. Time warnings will be given out before this requirement.
  - Be very mindful of this rule, exceptions are not given.
- All answers are final once submitted and cannot be changed.
  - …Unless otherwise stated!
