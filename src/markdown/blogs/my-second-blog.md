Hello world! I'm also here just testing the new blog functionality.

Recently (today) I've been reading this manga titled *Senryuu Shoujo* about this girl that can't speak and only expresses herself through writing poems (senryuu, as the title implies) and it is very adorable. I think there's an anime adaptation too but I haven't seen it so \*shrugs\*.

Did you know that: Senryuu are are a form of poetry like haikus in that it uses a 5-7-5 syllable structure, but they differ in that while haikus are traditionally about nature, senryuu are typically humorous and about humanity. If you like this sort of poetry, the [Haiku Society of America](https://www.hsa-haiku.org) hosts an annual contest and you can read the past winners on their site.

I particularly like the following haiku by Debbie Strange:

*stone cairns*

*a faded cap drifts*

*downriver*
