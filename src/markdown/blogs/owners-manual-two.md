## Description:
A (not so) brief reflection on the conclusion of this year's CodeBytes.
---
Everything's got a sense of finality to it!

If you don't know me, my name is **Haroldas Diska**, one of the cofounders behind Codebytes. I welcome you to our website, and I hope to see you in future competitions.

Let's start with the relevant news...

##### News & Accomplishments:

- We hosted our third-ever competition for CodeBytes on April 27th, 2024! While I was not personally there to attend and host the event, I've heard good things from the other founders about the event. We wished that we could've had this happen earlier in the year and fit in one more competition, but due to scheduling conflicts and recent decisions, we could only fit in this last one now.
- The winners of this competition come from multiple regions and only barely beat Neuqua Valley's second place team.
- We did not host a Theoretical Assessment event for this competition, as the host of the event was not present (that's me).
- The competition was hosted at **Naperville Central High School**.

Now, time for the **flavor text**.

##### Plans & Choices:

One of the struggles of hosting a novel competition involves finding a suitable place to host it at, and find a good time for students around the region to come. It's always a point of debate between the founders on when we should host, why that is the best time, and why it is the worst, how we should do it, and so on. Even when we believe we found a good date, there is always something that pushes us out.

Another problem that came up is that most of the founders this year will be graduating. This does not mean CodeBytes ends this year, rather, the administration is. While I cannot speak for all the founders when I say this, it is likely that we will still be in the background, monitoring and handling future contests, while passing on most of the work down to the new captains at the hosting schools for the upcoming 2024-2025 school year.

Arthur Cai, one of the founders, will be staying and guiding the future generations to ensure the eventual success of this project.

Now that we have everything set up, we expect better and more frequent results for the future.

Okay, enough formalities. Can I get to the fun stuff?

##### The Usual Banter

There's nothing much to talk about. The year is coming to a standstill as we seniors approach the end. Neuqua Valley has its graduation date on May 26th, and I cannot say that I am very excited.

One of the things I wish I could tell myself in the past (and maybe other people, too) is to enjoy what you have now. I did try to do that to an extent, but I found that as first semester became second semester of senior year, I haven't accomplished everything I wanted to. And that's okay!

Maybe some of these things aren't as important as I thought they were, or they are things that I could complete in university, later. But regardless, it's depressing.

I guess I could take this time to discuss what I want to do in university. Currently, my aspirations are to go for a Chemistry and Physics dual degree. I have not committed anywhere yet, due to the FAFSA issues. As for post-education, I'm not quite sure if I want to go for medical, or if I want to go for research. When I think about the future, there's just a lingering fog in my head. Honestly, it scares me a little, not knowing what lies ahead. But that's okay.

All I need to do now is say goodbye to everyone, and then the wind will blow towards where I want to go.

Thank you.

##### Final Notes

There is no planned date of the first competition for the 2024-2025 season.

Farewell.
