## Description:
This is likely the first actual blog post, as well as the first in a series of posts that I will call Owner's Manual.

Looks like the pieces are falling together!

If you don't know me, my name is **Haroldas Diska**, one of the cofounders behind Codebytes. I welcome you to our website, and I hope to see you in future competitions.

Let's start with the relevant news...

##### News & Accomplishments:

- The second-ever competition for Codebytes (officially) is scheduled to occur on Sunday, January 28th, from 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM CST! We've been working hard behind the scenes to make this possible, and we are ready for a great season ahead.\
- We have confirmed the events for the competition. We will be doing the Competition Programming Problems, the Theoretical Assessment, and the Front-End Development Events, alongside a new, experimental event that we call "Optimization". (Maybe we should make some better names...)
- If you wish to participate in the competition, please read the guidebook and get a team assembled to represent your school!
- The competition will be hosted at **Neuqua Valley High School**. Transportation will **NOT** be provided.
- Most, if not, all of the website is operational and finally ready for the future ahead!

Now, time for the **flavor text**.

##### Plans & Choices:

It's of no surprise that we want to make Codebytes flourish as much as other computer science competitions have. In its early stages, we grew greatly ambitious and came to the conclusion that even past our involvement in our computer science clubs and our high schools (going well into university... yikes..), we will continue working on the competition until it goes truly professional.

This means that we will continue to host Codebytes for years to come, and expand. We're hoping that we get the entirety of Northern Illinois on board, and maybe expand farther (can we conquer the Midwest? Who knows!)

Our next competition will likely happen soon after this upcoming one. We are still in the decision-making phase, but the season may be open until some point in the summer, in which case we may begin our next season for 2025!

While I can still be heard here, I, Haroldas Diska, pledge to work on Codebytes until I see it stable enough to last without us. That might take a while, but it will happen. Mark my words!

Hm.. That might be everything!

##### The Usual Banter

Ahhhhh, my favorite part of the blog, the part where I get to talk about myself! That's a joke, of course, all of this is fun to write.

I've recently been thinking about this one piece of writing, everyday I listen and read it out just to make sense of it and to find out what really compels me to it. Maybe someone can figure it out?
In case you're wondering, the text is "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night", by Dylan Thomas. Give it a read, and let me know personally what you thought!

Seeing the end of my senior year approaching so fast is scary, to say the least. There's still so many things that I want to do, and so little time to do it. To all the juniors, sophomores, even freshmen out there, make the most of it! Time really flies, especially when you're having fun.

I've met a lot of amazing people in my time through high school, and I still feel that I am as I come to the last few months. For example, Canchen. While I knew him throughout the halls from time to time, and of course him being a captain to NVHS's Computing Team, I became his friend officially toward the beginning of the 2023-2024 year. Not to say that the other captains aren't my friends, but Canchen himself has been very supportive for me and he's one of a few that have left an impact for me.

Shoutout to him, and the other owners!

Well, that's the end of my little rambles here, I'm out of ideas. But tune in for the next one, I'll probably write more then!

##### Final Notes

Normally, there'd be something here, but everything I needed to discuss was already mentioned. So, instead, give yourself a pat on the back for reading this far!

Have a good day!
