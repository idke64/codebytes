        "content": "Everything's got a sense of finality to it!\n\nIf you don't know me, my name is **Haroldas Diska**, one of the cofounders behind Codebytes. I welcome you to our website, and I hope to see you in future competitions.\n\nLet's start with the relevant news...\n\n##### News & Accomplishments:\n\n- We hosted our third-ever competition for CodeBytes on April 27th, 2024! While I was not personally there to attend and host the event, I've heard good things from the other founders about the event. We wished that we could've had this happen earlier in the year and fit in one more competition, but due to scheduling conflicts and recent decisions, we could only fit in this last one now.\n- The winners of this competition come from multiple regions and only barely beat Neuqua Valley's second place team.\n- We did not host a Theoretical Assessment event for this competition, as the host of the event was not present (that's me).\n- The competition was hosted at **Naperville Central High School**.\n\nNow, time for the **flavor text**.\n\n##### Plans & Choices:\n\nOne of the struggles of hosting a novel competition involves finding a suitable place to host it at, and find a good time for students around the region to come. It's always a point of debate between the founders on when we should host, why that is the best time, and why it is the worst, how we should do it, and so on. Even when we believe we found a good date, there is always something that pushes us out.\n\nAnother problem that came up is that most of the founders this year will be graduating. This does not mean CodeBytes ends this year, rather, the administration is. While I cannot speak for all the founders when I say this, it is likely that we will still be in the background, monitoring and handling future contests, while passing on most of the work down to the new captains at the hosting schools for the upcoming 2024-2025 school year.\n\nArthur Cai, one of the founders, will be staying and guiding the future generations to ensure the eventual success of this project.\n\nNow that we have everything set up, we expect better and more frequent results for the future.\n\nOkay, enough formalities. Can I get to the fun stuff?\n\n##### The Usual Banter\n\nThere's nothing much to talk about. The year is coming to a standstill as we seniors approach the end. Neuqua Valley has its graduation date on May 26th, and I cannot say that I am very excited.\n\nOne of the things I wish I could tell myself in the past (and maybe other people, too) is to enjoy what you have now. I did try to do that to an extent, but I found that as first semester became second semester of senior year, I haven't accomplished everything I wanted to. And that's okay!\n\nMaybe some of these things aren't as important as I thought they were, or they are things that I could complete in university, later. But regardless, it's depressing.\n\nI guess I could take this time to discuss what I want to do in university. Currently, my aspirations are to go for a Chemistry and Physics dual degree. I have not committed anywhere yet, due to the FAFSA issues. As for post-education, I'm not quite sure if I want to go for medical, or if I want to go for research. When I think about the future, there's just a lingering fog in my head. Honestly, it scares me a little, not knowing what lies ahead. But that's okay.\n\nAll I need to do now is say goodbye to everyone, and then the wind will blow towards where I want to go.\n\nThank you.\n\n##### Final Notes\n\nThere is no planned date of the first competition for the 2024-2025 season.\n\nFarewell."

        "content": "Looks like the pieces are falling together!\n\nIf you don't know me, my name is **Haroldas Diska**, one of the cofounders behind Codebytes. I welcome you to our website, and I hope to see you in future competitions.\n\nLet's start with the relevant news...\n\n##### News & Accomplishments:\n\n- The second-ever competition for Codebytes (officially) is scheduled to occur on Sunday, January 28th, from 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM CST! We've been working hard behind the scenes to make this possible, and we are ready for a great season ahead.\\\n- We have confirmed the events for the competition. We will be doing the Competition Programming Problems, the Theoretical Assessment, and the Front-End Development Events, alongside a new, experimental event that we call \"Optimization\". (Maybe we should make some better names...)\n- If you wish to participate in the competition, please read the guidebook and get a team assembled to represent your school!\n- The competition will be hosted at **Neuqua Valley High School**. Transportation will **NOT** be provided.\n- Most, if not, all of the website is operational and finally ready for the future ahead!\n\nNow, time for the **flavor text**.\n\n##### Plans & Choices:\n\nIt's of no surprise that we want to make Codebytes flourish as much as other computer science competitions have. In its early stages, we grew greatly ambitious and came to the conclusion that even past our involvement in our computer science clubs and our high schools (going well into university... yikes..), we will continue working on the competition until it goes truly professional.\n\nThis means that we will continue to host Codebytes for years to come, and expand. We're hoping that we get the entirety of Northern Illinois on board, and maybe expand farther (can we conquer the Midwest? Who knows!)\n\nOur next competition will likely happen soon after this upcoming one. We are still in the decision-making phase, but the season may be open until some point in the summer, in which case we may begin our next season for 2025!\n\nWhile I can still be heard here, I, Haroldas Diska, pledge to work on Codebytes until I see it stable enough to last without us. That might take a while, but it will happen. Mark my words!\n\nHm.. That might be everything!\n\n##### The Usual Banter\n\nAhhhhh, my favorite part of the blog, the part where I get to talk about myself! That's a joke, of course, all of this is fun to write.\n\nI've recently been thinking about this one piece of writing, everyday I listen and read it out just to make sense of it and to find out what really compels me to it. Maybe someone can figure it out?\nIn case you're wondering, the text is \"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night\", by Dylan Thomas. Give it a read, and let me know personally what you thought!\n\nSeeing the end of my senior year approaching so fast is scary, to say the least. There's still so many things that I want to do, and so little time to do it. To all the juniors, sophomores, even freshmen out there, make the most of it! Time really flies, especially when you're having fun.\n\nI've met a lot of amazing people in my time through high school, and I still feel that I am as I come to the last few months. For example, Canchen. While I knew him throughout the halls from time to time, and of course him being a captain to NVHS's Computing Team, I became his friend officially toward the beginning of the 2023-2024 year. Not to say that the other captains aren't my friends, but Canchen himself has been very supportive for me and he's one of a few that have left an impact for me.\n\nShoutout to him, and the other owners!\n\nWell, that's the end of my little rambles here, I'm out of ideas. But tune in for the next one, I'll probably write more then!\n\n##### Final Notes\n\nNormally, there'd be something here, but everything I needed to discuss was already mentioned. So, instead, give yourself a pat on the back for reading this far!\n\nHave a good day!\n"

I'm also here just testing the new blog functionality.\n\nRecently (today) I've been reading this manga titled *Senryuu Shoujo* about this girl that can't speak and only expresses herself through writing poems (senryuu, as the title implies) and it is very adorable. I think there's an anime adaptation too but I haven't seen it so \\*shrugs\\*.\n\nDid you know that: Senryuu are are a form of poetry like haikus in that it uses a 5-7-5 syllable structure, but they differ in that while haikus are traditionally about nature, senryuu are typically humorous and about humanity. If you like this sort of poetry, the [Haiku Society of America](https://www.hsa-haiku.org) hosts an annual contest and you can read the past winners on their site.\n\nI particularly like the following haiku by Debbie Strange:\n\n*stone cairns*\n\n*a faded cap drifts*\n\n*downriver*\n"
